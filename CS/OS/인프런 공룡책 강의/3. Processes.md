# 3. Processes

## 03. 프로세스의 이해: Chapter 3. Processes(Part 1) 

### 3.1 Process Concept

#### Process란?

* A **Process** is a program in execution: **실행 중인 프로그램**
* 프로세스는 OS의 작업 단위(unit of work)
* process가 작업을 수행하기 위해 필요한 자원
    * CPU time
    * memory
    * files
    * I/O devices
* OS는 process를 관리한다. 

#### The memory layout of a process

* The memory layout of a process is divided into multiple sections
    * Text section: the executable code(실행 가능한 코드)
    * Data section: global variables
    * Heep section
        * memory that is dynamically allocated during program run time
        * 자바에서 new
    * Stack section
        * temporary data storage when invoking functions
        * such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables
    * Heep과 Stack 영역은 JVM과 비슷하다.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int x;
int y;

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int *value;
    int i;
    
    values = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);
    
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        values[i] = i;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Process state

* New: the process is being created (생성)
* Running: Instructions are being executed. (실행, CPU 점령)
* Waiting: the process is waiting for some event to occur. (대기)
    * such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal.
* Ready: the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor. (준비: 다음 점령 차례)
* Terminated: the process has finished execution.(종료)

#### PCB, TCB

* **PCB(Process Control Block)** or TCB(Task Control Block)
    * Each process is represented in the operating system by the PCB.(process를 표현하는 구조체)
* A PCB contains many pieces of information associated with a specific process
    * **Process state**: new, run, wait, ready, terminated
    * **Program counter**: process가 실행 중 중간에 다른 process가 실행될 때 이전의 process의 수행 위치를 기억하는 register
    * CPU registers: IR, DR -> PC와 함께 **context**라고 표현
    * CPU-scheduling information
    * Memory-management informateion
    * Accounting information
    * I/O status information

#### thread

* A process is
    * a program that performs a single thread of execution(실타래...)
    * The single thread of control allows the process to perform
        * only one task at a time
    * Modern operating systems have extended the process concept
        * to allow a process to have multiple threads of execution
        * and thus to perform more than one task at a time
* A **thread** is a lightweight process
* multitasking, multiprocessing이 OS의 핵심 기능!!!
* process 내에서도 동시에 여러 일을 실행해야 하는 경우가 존재
    * 이때 process를 **multi-thread**로 나누어서 작업을 수행
    * 즉 thread가 process보다 저 작은 단위(개념)

### 3.2 Process Scheduling

#### Multi-programming

* The objective of **multiprogramming** is
    * to have some process running at all times (= at the same time, simultaneously, concurrently, <-> parallel)
    * so as to maximize CPU utilization(결국 CPU 사용성을 증가 시키기 위한 방법)
* The objective of **time sharing** is
    * to switch a CPU core among processes so frequently
    * that users can interact with each program while it is running.
    * 여러 process가 빈번하게 바뀌면서 순차적으로 실행하고 있지만 사용자 입장에서 동시에 여러 process를 처리하고 있다고 느낀다.

#### Scheduling Queue

* As processes enter the system, they are put into a **ready queue**
    * where they are ready and waiting to execute on a CPU's core.
    * CPU를 점령하기 전에 대기줄(ready queue)
* Processes that are waiting for a certain event to occur
    * are placed in a **wait queue.**
    * 특정한 event(I/O)가 발생하면 대기줄(wait queue)로 이동
* These queues are generally implemented
    * in the linked lists of PCBs.(Linked list로 구현)

#### Context Switch

* The **context** of a process is represented in the PCB.
* When an interrupt occurs
    * the system **save** the current **context** of the running process, (현재 상태를 저장해서)
    * so that, later, it can **restore** that **context** when it should be resumed. (재개할때 복원)
* The **context switch** is a task that
    * switches the CPU core to another process
    * performs a _state save_ of the current process
    * and a _state restore_ of a different process

### 3.3 Operations on Processes

#### parent and child process

* An operating system must provide a mechanism for
    * process creation (생성)
    * and process termination (소멸)
* A process may create several new processes
    * the creating process: a _parent_ process
    * a newly created process: a _child_ process

#### A _tree_ of processes

#### Two possibilities for execution and of address-space

* Two possibilities for execution
    * The parent continues to _execute concurrently_ with its children
    * The parent _waits_ until some or all of its children have terminated
        * 자식 process와 concurrrently하게 수행되거나, wait를 하거나...
* Two possibilities of address-space
    * The child process is a _duplicate_ of the parent process
    * The child process has a _new program_ loaded into it
    * 부모 process가 자식 process와 중복되는 주소를 같거나 자식이 새로운 주소를 할당 받거나...

#### A process terminates

* when it finishes executing its final statement
* **exit()** system call: asks OS to delete it
* OS deallocates(할당을 해제하다) and reclaims(되찾다) all the resources
    * allocated memories, open files, and I/O buffers, etc
    * OS는 process가 할당받은 자원들을 다시 되찾아오는 역할

> KT 사태에서 등장했던 `exit()`명령어    
> 직원이 이 명령어를 실행하 않았더랬지...

#### Zombie and Orphan

* **zombie** process: a process that has terminated
    * but whose parent has not yet called `wait()`
    * 자식은 종료되었지만 부모가 자식의 종료 상태를 회수하지 않은 경우
* **orphan** process: a process that has a parent process
    * who did not invoke(실행하다) `wait()` and instead terminated.
    * 부모가 자식보다 먼저 종료되는 경우
