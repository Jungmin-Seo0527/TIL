# 3. Processes

## 03. 프로세스의 이해: Chapter 3. Processes(Part 1)

### 3.1 Process Concept

#### Process란?

* A **Process** is a program in execution: **실행 중인 프로그램**
* 프로세스는 OS의 작업 단위(unit of work)
* process가 작업을 수행하기 위해 필요한 자원
    * CPU time
    * memory
    * files
    * I/O devices
* OS는 process를 관리한다.

#### The momory layout of a process

* The memory layout of a process is divided into multiple sections
    * Text section: the executable code(실행 가능한 코드)
    * Data section: global variables
    * Heep section
        * memory that is dynamically allocated during program run time
        * 자바에서 new
    * Stack section
        * temporary data storage when invoking functions
        * such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables
    * Heep과 Stack 영역은 JVM과 비슷하다.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int x;
int y;

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int *value;
    int i;
    
    values = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);
    
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        values[i] = i;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Process state

* New: the process is being created (생성)
* Running: Instructions are being executed. (실행, CPU 점령)
* Waiting: the process is waiting for some event to occur. (대기)
    * such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal.
* Ready: the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor. (준비: 다음 점령 차례)
* Terminated: the process has finished execution.(종료)

#### PCB, TCB

* **PCB(Process Control Block)** or TCB(Task Control Block)
    * Each process is represented in the operating system by the PCB.
* A PCB contains many pieces of information associated with a specific process
    * **Process state**
    * **Program counter**
    * CPU registers
    * CPU-scheduling information
    * Memory-management informateion
    * Accounting information
    * I/O status information
